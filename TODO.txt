condition variables on linux
change animation files so matrices can be copied directly to OpenGL without std.mem.copy
point light shadows
Rework RTRenderEngine API
proper scene editor
reduce 'bumpiness' of shadows
should model data include bitangents?
can vertices be cached after doing bone transformation in the shadow vertex shader for reuse in the main render pass?
debugging icons (layered over scene) for bones (position in 3d) and lights (position, angle, clipping planes)
port to d3d11
shadows for vertex lights?
skeletal animation blending for switching between animations
port to vulkan?
compressed texture formats
reference counting for shader instances, textures, mesh renderers, meshes, etc.
